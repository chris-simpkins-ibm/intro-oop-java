# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Course materials for my [CS 1331 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~simpkins/teaching/gatech/cs1331/) course at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/).  In addition to course materials, this repo contains the source for a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site, whose generated output I use as the course web site.

## Project Structure

- `slides/` contains the LaTeX source for my course slides.
- `code/` contains the example code I use in lectures.
- `exercise-solutions` contains sample solutions to programming exercises.
- `_layouts`, `css`, `fonts`, `images`, and `js` are used by Jekyll.  My site uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
